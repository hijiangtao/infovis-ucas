## TIPS

You should create a fold called `Your Group Name` in the `views` directory, and put your `VIS-Project.md` file in this folder. When you complete your writing, you can save it and link it in [VIS PROJECT](http://211.147.15.14/UCAS_16_Fall/index.php/VIS_Project)] like this:

```
* [https://github.com/ISCAS-VIS/infovis-ucas/blob/master/views/YourGroupName/VIS-Project.md Group XXX - "Your Team Name" VIS Project]
```

The files inside your group folder can be organized as follows:

```
- assets/ # put your media files, such as images, videos in this folder
- VIS-Project.md # name your vis project page in this way
```

You should copy the content above TIPS chapter into your markdown file directly and edit them, the following information helps you have a glance at how to use markdown grammar in a document.

* Insert Text: plain text is OK in markdown grammar.

* Insert a Link: `[description](link address)`
