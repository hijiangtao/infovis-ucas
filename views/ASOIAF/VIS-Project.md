# Group A_ASOIAF_VIS Project

## Visualization Data and Task Scenario (Checkpoint I)

This visualization project is about [*A Song of Ice and Fire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire), a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter [*George R. R. Martin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin). We hope to do some visualization of ASOIAF instead of instead of its adaption TV series [*Game of Thrones*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones), which is the target of most related visualizations. What's more, we also would like to use some data mining algorithms to explore the data we extract from the text, trying to get some new observations and interesting insights of the novel. 

PPT of the introduction: [Group_A_ASOIAF_VIS_Project_Checkpoint_I.pptx](http://ddl.escience.cn/f/BdPz)

Here are some details of our project:

### Data

We will firstly try to obtain the frequency of the emergence of every characters and places in each [POV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration) chapters by some basic text processing techniques. The dataset we hope to acquire will contain a n-by-p matrix X with n characters and places and p chapters collected from the novel. Each element contains either 0 or m indicating if the frequency of character's or place's appearance in the POV chapter.

### User & Task

The target user of our visualization can be

* The fans of the ASOIAF or GOT
1. The fans can enjoy new and vivid perspectives of their beloved stories. 
2. They can also recall their vague memory about the relations of the different scenarios and characters directly from the visualizations.
3. They might find out some ignored details through the visualizations.

* HBO Films
1. The publicity department of HBO Films can use the visualization to promote the new season.
2. The HBO Films can also use this visualization to stimulate discussion to keep the show a hot topic, which might contributes to the sale of the spin-off. 

* New Media and We Media
1. New Media and We Media can use this to promote the books and show, which can earn them money from the press and publisher.
2. They can also attract more followers by the visualization, which means their commercial value increases.

### Novelty

The visualization of an extremely popular story is an interesting job. Without any doubt many people has done some related works. However, most existing works focus on the TV series, and mostly just visualize the manually acquired statistical data directly. Therefore, here are some points will make our works new.

* We are going to focus on the novel instead of its adapted TV show. Besides, will use text processing techniques to process the txt form of the novel, which means we can use our methods to analyze other novels conveniently.

* Our goal is to explore the data extracted then visualize the relations we obtained through some data mining algorithms like [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), [MDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling), etc.

### Team and assignment

Please introduce your team members and task assignment (optionally, the project schedule)
* Chu Yiyao
1. Track the statistical data of places appeared in the novel.
2. Data mining and analysis.
3. Edit mediawiki and github of the project.

* Lin Yijun
1. Find the source of data, txt form of the novel by each POV chapter.
2. Extract data from the text.

* Gao Shan
1. Design database and construct server.
2. Track the statistical data of all characters, including the nicknames.

* Hao Yu
1. Use d3.js to visualize the outcome of data exploration.
